<h1>What am I?</h1>


<article class="home-post">
	<p class="drop-cap">Now, that I have three boys to raise, a house to attend to, a full-time job and a side career as a developer, I no longer have the spare time I used to be able to enjoy. Naturally, some of the leisure activities that filled my time and seemed so indispensable back then, have disappeared from my life, mainly movies and reading books (at least books unrelated to programming). Before kids, I was an avid reader, and walked into the theater almost every weekend. Then there was Netflix in bed, and I started to leave books unfinished. And suddenly, my two main hobbies were gone.</p>
<p>While I still don't have a clear path back to watching full length movies, I have found a solution for my book problem: audiobooks. It is not the same experience, and I still miss being able to lay in bed for two hours with a paperback in my hand, but it is a last resort solution that works. Because, among other things, it has allowed me to &ldquo;read&rdquo;  a book that has been on my list for ages: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555"><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></a>, by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman"">Daniel Kahneman.</a></p>
<p><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> is every bit as good as I expected, and I think (I hope) I will be a better, more self-aware human for having read it. Or, I will be better if I can remember anything it says: I am afraid that a downside of audiobooks may be that it will be harder for me to remember what I read (listen to). Because, a very useful tool for remembrance, visual memory, the ability to remember an idea because you can visualize where on the page it was written, is not engaged when listening to an audiobook. So, now that I have almost finished the book, I am left wondering if I remember anything at all. Will I be able to identify in me the biases that Kahneman lists in his book, or will I simply forget about them and move on with my life? There is one more bias that Kahneman doesn't talk about, which enables all the others: the bias to forget.</p>
<p>How to fight the bias to forget? One way could be to quote passages of the book right here. To type every word, every sentence that expresses an idea worth remembering and publish it on this site. This may make the idea stick around longer. So I am going to try. Here is Kahneman in the chapter <em>Expert Intuition: When Can We Trust It?</em></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Earlier I traced people's confidence in a belief to two related impressions: cognitive ease and coherence. We are confident when the story we tell ourselves comes easily to mind, with no contradiction and no competing scenario. But ease and coherence do not guarantee that a belief held with confidence is true. The associative machine is set to suppress doubt and to evoke ideas and information that are compatible with the currently dominant story. A mind that follows WYSIATI [What You See Is All There Is] will achieve high confidence much too easily by ignoring what it does not know. It is therefore not surprising that many of us are prone to have high confidence in unfounded intuitions. Klein and I eventually agreed on an important principle: the confidence that people have in their intuitions is not a reliable guide to their validity. In other words, do not trust anyone— including yourself— to tell you how much you should trust their judgment.</p>
	<p>If subjective confidence is not to be trusted, how can we evaluate the probable validity of an intuitive judgement? When do judgments reflect true expertise? When do they display an illusion of validity? The answer comes from the two basic conditions for acquiring a skill:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>an environment that is sufficiently regular to be predictable</li>
		<li>an opportunity to learn these regularities through prolonged practice</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When both these conditions are satisfied, intuitions are likely to be skilled. Chess is an extreme example of a regular environment, but bridge and poker also provide robust statistical regularities that can support skill. Physicians, nurses, athletes, and firefighters also face complex but fundamentally orderly situations. The accurate intuitions that Gary Klein has described are due to highly valid cues that expert's System 1 has learned to use, even if System 2 has not learned to name them. In contrast, stock pickers and political scientists who make long-term forecasts operate in a zero-validity environment. Their failures reflect the basic unpredictability of the events they try to forecast.</p>

<article class="home-post">
	<p class="drop-cap">I just changed the entire navigation system of this site. This change consisted of deleting my single most polished feature, the one I have worked on for longest, which I was by far proudest of. A right-side, responsive, sliding menu with hamburger button. One that actually worked. It slid smoothly. It opened and closed at the right times, responding to the right events. It seemed elegant (except for a few extra divs, which always made me feel a little uncomfortable). It was progressively enhanced, so it failed gracefully.</p>
	<p>Among other things, this feature contained my longest self-written JavaScript file. It is possible that this file was not a universal example of the purest functional programming. But it was my file. I wrote it. It contained an IIFE, its variables declared at the top, its function declarations following right after. OK, I used jQuery, maybe I am not a vanilla JavaScript ninja quite yet. So perhaps you wouldn't be impressed, but I was, because it was mine.</p>
	<p>I really hope that the simplified navigation system really does make my site simpler, more coherent, better-looking. Because if it doesn't, if after sacrificing my most beloved code my site gets worse, I am going to be pissed.</p>

<article class="home-post">
	<p class="drop-cap">Today, Alexander tried out for the baseball all-star team. His season so far has been somewhat inconsistent. He started hitting the ball off the machine regularly, and then suffered through a period of three or four games of missing the ball every time. His throwing has improved a lot. His catching ability is still developing. He is fairly good with ground balls, but has a harder time catching pop flies or line drives.</p>
<p>The odds were against him, but he wanted to try anyway, because he still thought he could make it. He has such great attitude and is so optimistic. I think I was more nervous for him than he was. He seemed to be unfazed by the possibility of failure, had no hesitation to try out and really hoped for the best. I am not sure where this drive comes from, not from me or Jessica, but I deeply admire it and feel that it is going to take him far.</p>
<p>It turns out that he completed a great performance today. The first ball he hit went straight to the outfield, the next two came out bouncing, would probably have allowed him a double or a triple, depending on the quality of the field players. The fourth was a foul ball and the fifth one he missed. That's a lot better than some of the other kids did, even some that have had a better batting average during the season.</p>
<p>I was so incredibly proud of him. After batting, I went to help him get ready for the next drill, and he was so happy. I said "¡Good job Alexander!", and he replied with a smile: "¡A lo mejor me van a pick!". He has worked hard all year to get better, and it really showed today. I get emotional thinking about it.</p>
<p>Coach Damon just texted me to say that Alexander didn't get picked, and this kind of broke my heart. But the good news is that they may put a B team together, and he is fairly sure that Alexander would make that team. I bet Alexander will look at the bright side, and be excited about that.</p>

<article class="home-post">
	<p>What I don't like about literary fiction:</p>
<p>I find that most writers' imagination is not as complex and nuanced as reality itself, so why read the inferior creation of somebody's mind when you can delight in the intricacies of the real world.</p> 
<p>Often enough, writers like to appear brilliant by showing off their mastery of the language. But to me, their heavy choice of words doesn't let the story shine through. It's as though the writer were an obstacle standing between the story and the reader. I feel that a writer is at his best when he removes himself from the act of writing, and becomes purely an instrument that powerful stories and ideas use to spread themselves through history.</p>

	<p class="drop-cap">If we had to pick an animal to describe our two older kids, Alexander would be a dog (loyal, dependable, resilient) and Max would be a cat (charming and loving, yet mercurial). Jessica and I discovered this last night, and couldn't help but laugh at the accuracy of the comparison.</p>
