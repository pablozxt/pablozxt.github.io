	<h1>Engineer with {{(site.time | date: "%Y") | minus: 2002}} years of experience in the water industry </h1>
	<p>I am an engineer working for the Water division of J.F.Shea Construction since 2004. I have experience as a Mechanical Engineer and as a Structural Estimator and Engineer.</p>

		<h2>Current Position</h2>
		<article>
				<h3>Structural Concrete Estimator</h3>
				<h4>Date:</h4><p>2012 - present</p>
				<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>Since January 2012 I have been working as a structural concrete estimator. I have been responsible for concrete quantity take-offs and pricing for very diverse water infrastructure projects, from construction of new facilities, to repairs or rehabilitation of exisiting structure or seismic retrofits. </p>

					<h4>The Best Parts</h4>
					<p>Thanks to my position as a structural estimator I have gotten the chance to learn a completely new discipline. As explained below, my field experience was highly focused on mechanical, commissioning and start-up. After I finished the Headworks project and came into our office to help estimate, I knew very little about concrete construction or formwork. However, we had enough mechanical estimators at the time, and needed some help with concrete, so, with the help of our senior structural estimator, I jumped right in. The second project I was asked to estimate was a $200M water treatment facility, so I had to learn fast!  </p>
					<p>When you are in the field you are involved with a single project for a long period of time, and you get to know that project in great detail. But it takes a long time until you move on to a different job. As an estimator, you only spend a few days or weeks working on any particular job. You get exposed to many more jobs, and I do enjoy this aspect of my position. Although the downside is that you know them in a more superficial manner. This is especially true for the jobs for which we do not become the successful low bidder.</p>
					<p>Probably the most important part of my job as an estimator is tracking the performance of jobs that we do end up building. This is what keeps me honest, and tells me if the assumptions I made were correct, if I understood the job correctly, if the production rates used were accurate, etc. Following closely the jobs I estimated has been a critical aspect of my work in estimating, and I have been very focused on it.</p>
					<p>My current position, when compared to my experience in the field, also gives me the opportunity to concentrate more in a single task. The field work is extremely hectic and involves serious multi-tasking, with few opportunities to focus on any one thing. I have done it, successfully I think, but I don't really enjoy it. I think that my nature is better suited for situations where I can concentrate on specific tasks for longer periods of time.</p>
					<p>One of the most appealing aspects of my position is the "every job is a puzzle" aspect of it. All the projects we estimate have peculiarities that make them all unique. I like trying to find out where the difficulty lies for each one of them, understanding what the schedule and the work constraints are going to be like and how they will affect cost.</p>
					<p>Finally, and this is also important, I get to work heavily with Excel. Yes, I love Excel. I love writing crazy, beautiful, multiple line formulas. It's the closest I get to programming at work. I have heavily refactored our take-off workbook, and this has helped me automate many tasks that previously had to be done manually. The result is more accurate and detailed estimates for less work. I have also built a spreadsheet system, ranging multiple workbooks, that allows me to track job performance weekly across multiple projects. Yes, we did not really have such a system before.</p>
					<h4>The Challenges</h4>
					<p>The first, most obvious challenge, has been estimating a new discipline without direct field experience in it (and overcoming the impostor syndrome associated with it). The answer I think has been, and still is to this day, to ask more experienced people lots of questions, especially dumb ones. We have a few excellent concrete superintendents and foremen and, whenever I see them, I try to bombard them with questions as much as I can (sorry, guys). It also helps me to call them or go visit them when I have a job that seems particularly challenging.</p>
					<p>A critical weapon to fight off the impostor syndrome problem has been, as explained above, to closely track job performance, especially the jobs I myself have estimated. That's been a humbling and extremely vaulable experience. I have also been involved with some jobs during the submittal and planning phases, which has also been very good for me.</p>
					<p>I have learned that drawing complex structures, and even preparing preliminary key plans showing the different concrete placements, as well as formwork sketches, can be tremendously valuable during the estimating phase. Drawing 3D models of complex structures has also helped me at times.</p>
					<p>When I first started working as an estimator, I had to become productive very quickly because we had a lot of work to bid with tight deadlines. The result was that I had to use many general rules of thumb and assumptions. Part of my work since then has been to unpack those rules of thumb, and find out what reality is like, learn what is needed for each particular job and situation and be more detailed-oriented.</p>
					<p>The biggest challenge of all, an industry-wide one, is having to compete on price only. There is no brand, no user experience, no customer relations in public work bidding. It's all about being the lowest bidder. This can be very frustrating. I understand in general terms why it is like that, but I secretly hope for a different model</p>
