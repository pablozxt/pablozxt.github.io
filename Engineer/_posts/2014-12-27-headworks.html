	<h4>Project Description:</h4>
	<p>This project provided a new headworks facility for OCSD Plant No. 2, which replaced a 40-year-old outdated installation. The new headworks is capable of reliably processing a design peak flow of 340 million gallons per day of raw sewage. The facility consists of 14 process structures, including among others a bar screen, screenings washings and loading facility, an influent pump station, grit basins and handling facilities and a new odor control system, which included the largest biological treatment facility of its kind in the country.</p>
	<h4>My Role</h4>
	<p>I came to this job in May of 2008, approximately three years after it started. When I got there, the concrete structures were mostly built, and the mechanical was well underway. My position was Mechanical Engineer responsible for the odor control system. I finished the installation, and then commissioned, started-up, operated and maintained the system until beneficial occupancy.</p>

		<h4>The Best Parts</h4>
		<p>Thanks to the Headworks project I got to learn a completely new technology. My job there became a crash course on all things odor control, of which I knew nothing before the job started. I quickly had to learn all about biological and chemical odor treatment, fan mechanics, instrumentation, control systems, etc.</p>
		<p>Also, and perhaps more importantly, this project gave me an opportunity to learn how to solve an entirely new set of challenges.</p>
