	<h4>Work:</h4>
	<p>The scope of this project was to build an Advanced Water Treatment Facility that would take in secondary effluent from an adjacent wastewater treatment plant and subject it to a purification process through the use of microfiltration, reverse osmosis and disinfection with ultraviolet light. This facility treats 70 million gallons of water per day, which are then used to recharge the aquifer and create a seawater intrusion barrier.</p>
	<h4>My Role</h4>
	<p>My position for this project was Mechanical Engineer assigned to the <a href="http://www.gwrsystem.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=15&Itemid=37" >reverse osmosis</a>, <a href="http://www.gwrsystem.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16&Itemid=38">ultraviolet light</a> and decarbonation buildings. I reviewed submittals and procured materials and equipment, participated in preparation of work plans, and supervised field installation. Once field installation was complete, I transitioned into commissioning and became part of the team that successfully started-up the facility</p>

		<h4>The Best Parts</h4>
		<p>This was a terrific project to get my career at J.F.Shea started. It involved state-of-the-art technology, it was our largest job at the time, and gave me an incredible opportunity to learn. I was involved with a great number of different pieces of equipment and materials, from the Reverse Osmosis 1,000 <abbr title="horse power">HP</abbr> <abbr title="Variable Frequncy Drive">VFD</abbr> driven pumps, to the <abbr title="Ultraviolet Light">UV</abbr> units, the <abbr title="Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic">FRP</abbr> decarbonation tanks, the Foundation Fieldbus enabled electrical valve actuators, electropolished 316 stainless steel pipes, etc. Most importantly, I interacted with a good number of highly experienced, bright people and soaked as much knowledge from them as I could. As a bonus, this job got a big deal of <a href="http://www.gwrsystem.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=257&Itemid=84">national attention</a>, which made it even more exciting!</p>
		<h4>The Challenges</h4>
		<p>I was fresh off the boat when I started this job with J.F.Shea, so my main two challenges early on were getting used to working in a new language and a new culture. Sure I had studied Engglish, and I had scored really high in my <abbr title="Test of English as a Foreign Language">TOEFL</abbr></p>
