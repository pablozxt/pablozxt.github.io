title: What I don't like about writers

---

<p>What I don't like about literary fiction:</p>
<p>I find that most writers' imagination is not as complex and nuanced as reality itself, so why read the inferior creation of somebody's mind when you can delight in the intricacies of the real world.</p> 
<p>Often enough, writers like to appear brilliant by showing off their mastery of the language. But to me, their heavy choice of words doesn't let the story shine through. It's as though the writer were an obstacle standing between the story and the reader. I feel that a writer is at his best when he removes himself from the act of writing, and becomes purely an instrument that powerful stories and ideas use to spread themselves through history.</p>
