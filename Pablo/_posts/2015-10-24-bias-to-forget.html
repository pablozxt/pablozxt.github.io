<p class="drop-cap">Now, that I have three boys to raise, a house to attend to, a full-time job and a side career as a developer, I no longer have the spare time I used to be able to enjoy. Naturally, some of the leisure activities that filled my time and seemed so indispensable back then, have suddenly disappeared from my life, mainly movies and reading books (at least books unrelated to programming). Before kids, I was an avid reader, and walked into the theater almost every weekend. Then there was Netflix in bed, and I started to leave books unfinished. And suddenly, my two main hobbies were gone.</p>
<p>While I still don't have a clear path back to watching full length movies, I have found a solution for my book problem: audiobooks. It is not the same experience, and I still miss being able to lay in bed for two hours with a paperback in my hand, but it is a last resort solution that works. Because, among other things, it has allowed me to &ldquo;read&rdquo;  a book that has been on my list for ages: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555"><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></a>, by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman"">Daniel Kahneman.</a></p>
<p><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> is every bit as good as I expected, and I think (I hope) I will be a better, more self-aware human for having read it. Or, I will be better if I can remember anything it says: I am afraid that a downside of audiobooks may be that it will be harder for me to remember what I read (listen to). Because, a very useful tool for remembrance, visual memory, the ability to remember an idea because you can visualize where on the page it was written, is not engaged when listening to an audiobook. So, now that I have almost finished the book, I am left wondering if I remember anything at all. Will I be able to identify in me the biases that Kahneman lists in his book, or will I simply forget about them and move on with my life? There is one more bias that Kahneman doesn't talk about, which enables all the others: the bias to forget.</p>
<p>How to fight the bias to forget? One way could be to quote passages of the book right here. To type every word, every sentence that expresses an idea worth remembering, to publish it on this site and link to it. This may make the idea stick around longer. So I am going to try. Here is Kahneman in the chapter <em>Expert Intuition: When Can We Trust It?</em></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Earlier I traced people's confidence in a belief to two related impressions: cognitive ease and coherence. We are confident when the story we tell ourselves comes easily to mind, with no contradiction and no competing scenario. But ease and coherence do not guarantee that a belief held with confidence is true. The associative machine is set to suppress doubt and to evoke ideas and information that are compatible with the currently dominant story. A mind that follows WYSIATI [What You See Is All There Is] will achieve high confidence much too easily by ignoring what it does not know. It is therefore not surprising that many of us are prone to have high confidence in unfounded intuitions. Klein and I eventually agreed on an important principle: the confidence that people have in their intuitions is not a reliable guide to their validity. In other words, do not trust anyone— including yourself— to tell you how much you should trust their judgment.</p>
	<p>If subjective confidence is not to be trusted, how can we evaluate the probable validity of an intuitive judgement? When do judgments reflect true expertise? When do they display an illusion of validity? The answer comes from the two basic conditions for acquiring a skill:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>an environment that is sufficiently regular to be predictable</li>
		<li>an opportunity to learn these regularities through prolonged practice</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When both these conditions are satisfied, intuitions are likely to be skilled. Chess is an extreme example of a regular environment, but bridge and poker also provide robust statistical regularities that can support skill. Physicians, nurses, athletes, and firefighters also face complex but fundamentally orderly situations. The accurate intuitions that Gary Klein has described are due to highly valid cues that expert's System 1 has learned to use, even if System 2 has not learned to name them. In contrast, stock pickers and political scientists who make long-term forecasts operate in a zero-validity environment. Their failures reflect the basic unpredictability of the events they try to forecast.</p>
