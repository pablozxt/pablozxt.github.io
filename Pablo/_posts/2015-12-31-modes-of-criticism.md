<p class="drop-cap">During the course of the <a href="http://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/surviving-the-cosmos">&ldquo;Surviving the Cosmos&rdquo;</a> episode of the <a href="http://www.samharris.org/podcast">Waking Up</a> podcast, Sam Harris and <a href="http://www.daviddeutsch.org.uk/">David Deutsch</a> engage in a conversation (starting at minute 1:22) about moral relativism. Sam Harris expresses worry about this view of morality:</p>

>the notion that. . . there is no such thing as moral progress, there is no place to stand to say that one culture is better than another. . . There is no such thing as moral truth. And many people have drawn this lesson somehow from twentieth century science and twentieth century philosophy. Ano now in the twenty first century, again, even very smart people, even, you know, physicist whose names will be well known to you, with whom I've collided around this point, that there is no place to stand to say that slavery is wrong. To say that slavery is wrong is a deeply unscientific statment on this view.

Sam Harris goes on to point out that, according to the moral relativists, to say something critical about the Taliban is controversial. He also proposes an argument against this view: we should acknowledge that there is a link between morality and human well-being, and we do know something about human well being, which gives us a place to stand to make decisions about how we all should live. David Deutsch, however, has a different response, which I find extremely insightful: 

>The idea that there can't be such a thing as morality because we can't do an experiment to test it, your answer to that seems to be &lsquo;but we can if we adopt a simple assumption of human. . . well-being&rsquo;. Now I think that actually that's true, but I don't think you have to rest on that. I think the criterion of human well-being can be a conclusion, not an axiom.
>
> Because this idea that there can't be any moral knowledge because it can't be derived from the senses, is exactly the same argument that people made when they say there can't be any scientific knowledge because it can't be derived from the senses. In the twentieth century, empiricism was found to be nonsense, and some people therefore concluded that scientific knowledge is nonsense. But the real truth is that science is not based on empiricism, is based on reason, and so is morality. 
>
>So, if you adopt a rational attitude to morality, and therefore say that morality consists of moral knowledge, which consists always of conjectures, doesn't have any basis, doesn't need a basis, only needs modes of criticism, and those modes of criticism operate by criteria, which are themselves subject to modes of criticism. Then, you come to a sort of transcendent moral truth from which your one emerges as an approximation, which is that institutions which suppress the growth of moral knowledge are immoral. Because they can only be right if the final truth is already known, but if all knowledge is conjectural and subject to improvement, then protecting the means of improving knowledge is more important than any particular piece of knowledge.

I must acknowledge that I have not read yet David Deutsch *[The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451744028&sr=8-1&keywords=David+Deutsch)*, as this podcast was my introduction to him. So I may not fully appreciate the meaning he packs behind words such as &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; or &lsquo;criticism&rsquo;. However, his words really resonated with me and clarified my own thinking. 

I have for a long time stated or assumed that all knowledge is scientific, in the sense that all the truths we accept are nothing but hypothesis, susceptible of being replaced at any time by more accurate explanations. I had however failed to make a connection between this point of view and morality.
