<p class="drop-cap">As time goes by since I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555"><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></a>, there is a chapter that sticks in my head as one I particularly don&rsquo;t want to forget about. It is called &ldquo;Risk Policies&rdquo;, and I find it relevant for my current professional activity as an estimator, as well as my behavior as an investor:</p>
<blockquote><p>The great Paul Samuelson &mdash; a giant among the economists of the twentieth century&mdash;famously asked a friend (call him Sam) whether he would accept a gamble on the toss of a coin in which he could lose $100 or win $200. His friend responded, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t bet because I would feel the $100 loss more than the $200 gain. But I&rsquo;ll take you on if you promise to let me make 100 such bets.&rsquo;</p> 
	<p>. . . .</p> 
	<p>Now I have a sermon ready for Sam if he rejects the offer of a single highly favorable gamble played once, and for you if you share his unreasonable aversion to losses:</p>
	<p>I sympathize with your aversion to losing any gamble, but it is costing you a lot of money. Please consider this question: Are you on your deathbed? Is this the last offer of a small favorable gamble that you will ever consider? Of course, you are unlikely to be offered exactly this gamble again, but you will have many opportunities to consider attractive gambles with stakes that are very small relative to your wealth. You will do yourself a large financial favor if you are able to see each of these gambles as part of a bundle of small gambles and rehearse the mantra that will get you significantly closer to economic rationality: you win a few, you lose a few. . . . Remember these qualifications when using the mantra:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It works when the gambles are genuinely independent of each other; it does not apply to multiple investments in the same industry, which would all go bad together.</li>
		<li>It works only when the possible loss does not cause you to worry about your total wealth. If you would take the loss as significant bad news about your economic future, watch it!</li>
		<li>It should not be applied to long shots, where the probability of winning is very small for each bet</li>
	</ul>
