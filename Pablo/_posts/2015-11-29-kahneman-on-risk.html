title: Kahneman on risk

<h2 class="visually-hidden"><a href="{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a></h2>
<p class="drop-cap">As time goes by since I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555"><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></a>, there is a chapter that sticks in my head as one I particularly don&rsquo;t want to forget about. It is called &ldquo;Risk Policies&rdquo;, and I find it relevant for my current professional activity as an estimator, as well as my behavior as an investor:</p>
<blockquote><p>The great Paul Samuelson &mdash; a giant among the economists of the twentieth century&mdash;famously asked a friend (call him Sam) whether he would accept a gamble on the toss of a coin in which he could lose $100 or win $200. His friend responded, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t bet because I would feel the $100 loss more than the $200 gain. But I&rsquo;ll take you on if you promise to let me make 100 such bets.&rsquo;</p> 
	<p>. . . .</p> 
	<p>Now I have a sermon ready for Sam if he rejects the offer of a single highly favorable gamble played once, and for you if you share his unreasonable aversion to losses:</p>
	<div class="subquote">
		<p>I sympathize with your aversion to losing any gamble, but it is costing you a lot of money. Please consider this question: Are you on your deathbed? Is this the last offer of a small favorable gamble that you will ever consider? Of course, you are unlikely to be offered exactly this gamble again, but you will have many opportunities to consider attractive gambles with stakes that are very small relative to your wealth. You will do yourself a large financial favor if you are able to see each of these gambles as part of a bundle of small gambles and rehearse the mantra that will get you significantly closer to economic rationality: you win a few, you lose a few. . . . Remember these qualifications when using the mantra:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It works when the gambles are genuinely independent of each other; it does not apply to multiple investments in the same industry, which would all go bad together.</li>
			<li>It works only when the possible loss does not cause you to worry about your total wealth. If you would take the loss as significant bad news about your economic future, watch it!</li>
			<li>It should not be applied to long shots, where the probability of winning is very small for each bet.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you have the emotional discipline that this rule requires, you will never consider a small gamble in isolation or be loss averse for a small gamble until you are actually on your deathbed&mdash;and not even then.</p>
	</div>
	<p>This advice is not impossible to follow. Experienced traders in financial markets live it every day, shielding themselves from the pain of losses by <em>broad framing</em>.</p>
	<p>. . . .</p>
	<p>The combination of loss aversion and narrow framing is a costly curse.</p>
	<p>. . . .</p>
	<p>Decision makers who are prone to narrow framing construct a preference every time they face a risky choice. They would do better by having a <em>risk policy</em> that they routinely apply whenever a relevant problem arises. . . . A risk policy is a broad frame. . . . The relevant issue is your ability to reduce or eliminate the pain of the occasional loss by the thought that the policy that left you exposed to it will almost certainly be financially advantageous over the long run.</p>
	<p>A risk policy that aggregates decisions is analogous to the outside view of planning problems that I discussed earlier. The outside view shifts the focus from the specifics of the current situation to the statistics of the outcomes in similar situations. The outside view is a broad frame for thinking about plans. A risk policy is a broad frame that embeds a particular risky choice in a set of similar choices.</p>
	<p>The outside view and the risk policy are remedies against two distinct biases that affect many decisions: the exaggerated optimism of the planning fallacy and the exaggerated caution induced by loss aversion. The two biases oppose each other. Exaggerated optimism protects individuals and organizations from the paralyzing effects of loss aversion; loss aversion protects them from the follies of overconfident optimism. The upshot is rather comfortable for the decision maker. Optimists believe that the decisions they make are more prudent than they really are, and loss-averse decision makers correctly reject marginal propositions that they might otherwise accept. There is no guarantee, of course, that the biases cancel out in every situation. An organization that could eliminate both excessive optimism and excessive loss aversion should do so. The combination of the outside view with a risk policy should be the goal.</p>
	<p>Richar Thaler tells of a discussion about decision making he had with the top managers of the 25 divisions of a large company. He asked them to consider a risky option in which, with equal probabilities, they could lose a large amount of the capital they controlled or earn double that amount. None of the executives was willing to take such a dangerous gamble. Thaler then turned to the CEO of the company, who was also present, and asked for his opinion. Without hesitation, the CEO answered, &lsquo;I would like all of them to accept their risks.&rsquo; In the context of that conversation, it was natural for the CEO to adopt a broad frame that encompassed all 25 bets. Like Sam facing 100 coin tosses, he could count on statistical aggregation to mitigate the overall risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both as an estimator and as an investor, I should have a risk policy and be aware of the outside view. But, do I? I think so. They may not be perfect, but I do believe I have set up mechanisms that follow these general principles.</p>
<p>As an estimator, I keep track of actual historical costs from the field. I maintain an Excel database (in the process of being converted to MySQL) which reflects the actual costs charged to each of our activities. I also try to identify for each activity the factors that make it statistically significant, with columns, notes, drawings and pictures that reflect the actual conditions of the installation. This is the outside view: the detail and metadata provided by the database for each activity allow me to navigate the fine line between optimism and loss aversion by helping me choose production rates that are consistent with our history. But it is also the risk policy: my database allows me to aggregate our actual costs and the comparison with our estimated budgets for all our jobs. This aggregation provides the broad framing required to see individual bets as part of a larger set of bets.</p>
<p>As an investor, I have created an investment strategy that prevents me from making really dumb mistakes, and, hopefully, encourages me to make long-term bets with favorable odds and limited downside. Briefly explained, I only allow myself to trade once at the beginning of every quarter. I have set up reminders to check and rebalance my portfolio on January 1<sup>st</sup>, April 1<sup>st</sup>, July 1<sup>st</sup> and October 1<sup>st</sup>. If I don&rsquo;t adjust it on those dates (or up to a couple of days later if I don&rsquo;t get to it), then I have to leave my accounts alone for the rest of the quarter.</p>
<p>When I do rebalance my portfolio, I can only change the totals between my accounts by a very small percentage, currently not more than 2.5%. At any given point I can&rsquo;t transfer more than 2.5% of stocks to bonds or vice-versa. And I can&rsquo;t increase or decrease the allocation of any subcategory (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, international, etc) by more than 2.5%. This greatly limits the potential for mistakes caused by sudden decisions based on news, market information or emotions.</p>
<p>Any adjustments not-to-exceed 2.5% are made with a contrarian view in mind. By looking at several key indicators, among them the CAPE ratio, I try to slowly decrease my stock allocation when stocks are priced higher and increase it when they are cheaper. Finally, my overall stock allocation cannot be adjusted below a certain percentage based on my age, currently 70%. At any given point, even when I am at my most conservative, I am limited to a 30% fixed income percentage based on the fact that I am young worker with a really long time horizon.</p> 
<p>This discussion doesn&rsquo;t touch on dollar-cost-averaging, which is one of my favorite investment strategies, but also a default option and a no-brainer for retirement accounts.</p>
<p>I recognize that certain aspects of my investment approach are not standard practice recommended by experts for individual investors. I believe my approach is better. I could be wrong. I am incurring some risk of underperfomance, but I have implemented safeguards to limit that risk.</p>
