title: All star try-outs

---

<p>Today, Alexander tried out for the baseball all-star team. His season so far has been somewhat inconsistent. He started hitting the ball off the machine regularly, and then suffered through a period of three or four games of missing the ball every time. His throwing has improved a lot. His catching ability is still developing. He is fairly good with ground balls, but has a harder time catching pop flies or line drives.</p>
<p>The odds were against him, but he wanted to try anyway, because he still thought he could make it. He has such great attitude and is so optimistic. I think I was more nervous for him than he was. He seemed to be unfazed by the possibility of failure, had no hesitation to try out and really hoped for the best. I am not sure where this drive comes from, not from me or Jessica, but I deeply admire it and feel that it is going to take him far.</p>
<p>It turns out that he completed a great performance today. The first ball he hit went straight to the outfield, the next two came out bouncing, would probably have allowed him a double or a triple, depending on the quality of the field players. The fourth was a foul ball and the fifth one he missed. That's a lot better than some of the other kids did, even some that have had a better batting average during the season.</p>
<p>I was so incredibly proud of him. After batting, I went to help him get ready for the next drill, and he was so happy. I said "¡Good job Alexander!", and he replied with a smile: "¡A lo mejor me van a pick!". He has worked hard all year to get better, and it really showed today. I get emotional thinking about it.</p>
<p>Coach Damon just texted me to say that Alexander didn't get picked, and this kind of broke my heart. But the good news is that they may put a B team together, and he is fairly sure that Alexander would make that team. I bet Alexander will look at the bright side, and be excited about that.</p>
