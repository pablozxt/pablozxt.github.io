title: Deleted sliding menu

---

<p>I just changed the entire navigation system of this site. This change consisted of deleting my single most polished feature, the one I have worked on for longest, which I was by far proudest of. A right-side, responsive, sliding menu with hamburger button. One that actually worked. It slid smoothly. It opened and closed at the right times, responding to the right events. It seemed elegant (except for a few extra divs, which always made me feel a little uncomfortable). It was progressively enhanced, so it failed gracefully.</p>
	<p>Among other things, this feature contained my longest self-written JavaScript file. It is possible that this JavaScript was not a universal example of the purest functional programming. But it was my file. I wrote it. It contained an IIFE, its variables declared at the top, its function declarations following right after. OK, I used jQuery, maybe I am not a vanilla JavaScript ninja quite yet. So perhaps you wouldn't be impressed, but I was, because it was mine.</p>
	<p>I really hope that the simplified navigation system really does make my site simpler, more coherent, better-looking. Because if it doesn't, if after sacrificing my most beloved code my site gets worse, I am going to be pissed.</p>
