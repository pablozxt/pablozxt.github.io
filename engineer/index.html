			<h5>Description</h5>
			<p>Since January 2012 I have been working as a structural concrete estimator. I am responsible for concrete quantity take-offs and pricing for very diverse water infrastructure projects, from construction of new facilities, to rehabilitation of existing structures or seismic retrofits.</p>
			<p>I also track closely our cost performance across multiple jobs. This information feeds my estimating models and helps me stay in touch and more integrated with our field operations.</p>
			<p>Sometimes we get jobs which have accelerated schedules and require early planning after bid time. I usually help with scheduling, procurement, drawings and submittals for these jobs until they get appropriately staffed.</p>

				<h5>The Best Parts</h5>
				<p>Thanks to my position as a structural estimator I have had the chance to learn a completely new discipline. As explained below, my field experience was highly focused on mechanical, commissioning and start-up. After I finished the Headworks project and came into our office to help estimate, I knew little about concrete construction or formwork. However, we had enough mechanical estimators at the time, and needed some help with concrete, so, with the assistance of our senior structural estimator, I jumped right in. The second project I was asked to estimate was a $200M water treatment facility, so I had to learn fast!  </p>
				<p>In the field, I was involved with a single project at a time. I got to know those projects in great detail, but it took a long time to move to the next job and learn a different set of technologies. As an estimator, I only spend a few days or weeks working on any particular project, so I get exposed to many more jobs. I enjoy this aspect of my position. Although the downside is that I know these projects in a more superficial manner.</p>
				<p>Probably the most important part of my job as an estimator is tracking the performance of the jobs that we do end up building. This is what keeps me honest, and tells me if the assumptions I made were correct, if I understood the job correctly, if the production rates used were accurate, etc. Following closely the jobs I estimated has been a critical aspect of my work as an estimator.</p>
				<p>One of the most appealing aspects of my position is that every job is a puzzle. Every project we estimate has peculiarities that makes it unique. I enjoy figuring out where the difficulty lies for each one of them, understanding what the schedule and the work constraints are going to be like, and how they will affect cost.</p>
				<p>Finally, and this is important, I get to work heavily with Excel. Yes, I love Excel. I love writing crazy, beautiful, multiple line formulas. It&rsquo;s the closest I get to programming at work. I have heavily refactored our take-off workbook, and this has helped me automate many tasks that previously had to be done manually. The result is more accurate and detailed estimates for less work. I have also built a spreadsheet system, ranging multiple workbooks, that allows me to track job performance weekly across multiple projects. Yes, we did not really have such a system before. And yes, perhaps we should be using a database instead.</p>
				<h5>The Challenges</h5>
				<p>The first, most obvious challenge, has been estimating a new discipline without direct field experience in it (and overcoming the impostor syndrome associated with it). The answer, I think, has been to ask more experienced people lots of questions, especially dumb ones. We have a few excellent concrete superintendents and foremen and, whenever I see them, I try to bombard them with questions as much as I can (sorry, guys). It also helps me to call them or visit them when I have a job that seems particularly challenging.</p>
				<p>A critical weapon to fight off the impostor syndrome problem has been, as explained above, to closely track job performance, especially the jobs I have estimated. That&rsquo;s been a humbling and extremely valuable experience.</p>
				<p>When I first started working as an estimator, I had to become productive very quickly because we had a lot of work to bid with tight deadlines. The result was that I had to use many general rules of thumb and assumptions. Part of my work since then has been to unpack those rules of thumb, learn what is needed for each particular situation, and be more detailed-oriented.</p>
				<p>The biggest challenge of all, an industry-wide one, is having to compete on price only. There is no brand, no user experience, no customer relations in public work bidding. It&rsquo;s all about being the lowest bidder. This can be frustrating. I secretly envy other industries where you don&rsquo;t have to race to the bottom, and can instead strive to create the best product and provide a great user experience.</p>

			<h5>Project Description:</h5>
			<p>This project provided a new headworks facility for OCSD Plant No. 2, which replaced a 40-year-old outdated installation. The new headworks is capable of processing a design peak flow of 340 million gallons per day of raw sewage. The facility consists of 14 process structures, including among others a bar screen, screenings washings and loading facility, an influent pump station, grit basins and handling facilities and a new odor control system, which included the largest biological treatment facility of its kind in the country.</p>
			<h5>My Role</h5>
			<p>I came to this job in May of 2008, approximately three years after it started. I became responsible for the odor control system. I finished the installation, and then commissioned, started-up, operated and maintained the system until beneficial occupancy.</p>

				<h5>The Best Parts</h5>
				<p>Thanks to the Headworks project I got to learn a completely new technology. My job there became a crash course on all things odor control, of which I knew nothing before the job started. I quickly had to study all about biological and chemical odor treatment, fan mechanics and vibrations, instrumentation, control systems, etc.</p>
				<p>Also, and perhaps more importantly, this project gave me an opportunity to learn how to overcome an entirely new set of difficulties. It may not have seemed to me like such a good thing at the time, but looking back on it, the setbacks that we suffered in this job helped me become more resilient. Read below for more information.</p>
				<h5>The Challenges</h5>
				<p>One word: fans. In particular, the biotower and the scrubber fiberglass centrifugal fans. A total of 24 of them, which experienced many different problems. Too many times I felt like we had fixed them for good, only to see a new problem creep up.</p> 
				<p>These fans were already installed when I got to the job site. After a while, it was determined that they were not painted correctly, and the owner requested that they be sandblasted and repainted. So we took them apart, repainted the frames, put them back together, and re-installed them. All done on site.<p> 
				<p>They also experienced several vibration issues. Some had out-of-spec vibrations that could be fixed through balancing. Others, the variable frequency driven biotower fans in particular, experienced natural frequency peaks that could not simply be addressed by balancing. A joint team of vibration experts, assembled between our customers and ourselves, got together to analyze the problem and find the most appropriate solution. It was determined that the fan mounting should be changed to softer durometer bearing pads.</p>
				<p>After all this, when all 24 fans had been changed to the new mounting and finely balanced, we started to slowly lose fan outboard bearings. After the second or third bearing, it became obvious that this was a system wide issue. The manufacturer, with our assistance, changed the bearing type from a single set screw to an eccentric load type. Three shafts and fan wheels had to be replaced too. After this, with all fans running, I left the job.</p>
				<p>But, of course, it didn&rsquo;t end there. I received a phone call a couple of months later. The new bearings had failed again! And they were failing at a faster rate too. I didn&rsquo;t participate directly in this last repair, even though I still felt ownership and tried to help as much as I could. We ended up replacing all the eccentric bearings to a double set screw configuration, and also smoothed out the fan operation by slowing down the <abbr title="Proportional-Integral-Derivative">PID</abbr> controller reactions, and these seem to have been the right solutions. The fans have been running, to my knowledge, mostly trouble-free ever since.</p>
				<p>I will confess: these fans tested my patience. At some point I wanted to give up. After the single set screw bearings failed, I asked for a new assignment. I did not want to fix them again, and, frankly, felt like I may have been part of the problem. My colleagues tell me I wasn&rsquo;t, but I am sure I made some mistakes. I ended up not getting a new assignment, and replacing the single set screw bearings. But eventually it all got resolved, and I am happy that it did.</p>

				<h5>The Best Parts</h5>
				<p>This was a terrific project to get my career at J.F.Shea started. It involved state-of-the-art technology, it was our largest job at the time, and gave me an incredible opportunity to learn. I was involved with a great number of different pieces of equipment and materials, from the Reverse Osmosis 1,000 <abbr title="horse power">HP</abbr> <abbr title="Variable Frequncy Drive">VFD</abbr> driven pumps, to the <abbr title="Ultraviolet Light">UV</abbr> units, the <abbr title="Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic">FRP</abbr> decarbonation tanks, the Foundation Fieldbus enabled electrical valve actuators, electropolished 316 stainless steel piping, etc. Most importantly, I interacted with a good number of highly experienced, bright people and soaked as much knowledge from them as I could. As a bonus, this job got a big deal of <a href="http://www.gwrsystem.com/index.php&amp;option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=257&amp;Itemid=84">national attention</a>, which made it even more exciting!</p>
				<br>
				<h5>The Challenges</h5>
				<p>I was fresh off the boat when I started this job with J.F.Shea, so one of my main challenges early on was getting used to working in a new language. Sure I had studied English, and I had scored very high in my <abbr title="Test of English as a Foreign Language">TOEFL</abbr>, of course I had taken college classes in English, but what the heck was a valve diaphragm, and what does it mean when people say 10-4 to each other, or when they ask me where my twenty is? They don&rsquo;t teach those things in school.<p> 
				<p>Adapting to a new culture was also difficult at first. People here, especially in construction, are more of the straight shooter, sometimes rough around the edges kind, whereas in Spain we are more of the hand-holding type. But I realized quickly that this was a swim-or-sink, get-it-done environment, so I jumped right in. I made some mistakes, learned some lessons from them, and also must have gotten a few things right.</p>

			<h5>Description</h5>
			<p>At my first job out of college, I developed computer models of water supply, sewer and storm drain systems. We used these models to simulate extreme loading conditions and future city expansion plans, find areas where existing infrastructure needed improvement and propose solutions. I worked on projects for the spanish cities of Almeria, Benalmádena, Motril, Almuñecar and Salobreña. In addition to doing the technical work of building the models, I was the liaison with our customers for some of these projects and coordinated a small team of engineers.</p>
			<p>Towards the end of my time with Mejoras, we started to expand our activities into the telecommunications market. As part of this effort, I participated on a successful bid proposal for spanish cable operator <a href="https://www.ono.es/">Ono</a> to get a license to build and operate a cable service in the region of Castilla La Mancha.</p>

				<p>Having direct contact with customers was a useful learning experience. The same can be said for managing a group of people. I extended my knowledge of hydraulics and hydrology, and, on the software side, learned to use GIS software <a href="http://www.mapinfo.com/product/mapinfo-professional/">MapInfo</a> pretty well, got some exposure to relational databases and wrote basic SQL queries.</p>
				<h5>The Challenges</h5>
				<p>Most Spanish municipalities at the time did not have at their disposal all the information that the <a href="http://www.innovyze.com/products/infoworks_cs/">InfoWorks</a> models require. In order to complete the work, we had to make assumptions, and no matter how reasonable we thought our assumptions were, one has to question the accuracy and usefulness of the model and, therefore, our whole endeavor. In other words, I am not sure that we brought a lot of value to our customers, and that was in my view the biggest challenge.</p>
