<h1>Biased to Forget</h1>


<article class="home-post">
	<h2 class="visually-hidden"><a href="/pablo/2015/12/31/modes-of-criticism.html">Modes of Criticism</a></h2>
<p class="drop-cap">During the course of the <a href="http://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/surviving-the-cosmos">&ldquo;Surviving the Cosmos&rdquo;</a> episode of the <a href="http://www.samharris.org/podcast">Waking Up</a> podcast, Sam Harris and <a href="http://www.daviddeutsch.org.uk/">David Deutsch</a> engage in a conversation (starting at minute 1:22) about moral relativism. Sam Harris expresses worry about this view of morality:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the notion that. . . there is no such thing as moral progress, there is no place to stand to say that one culture is better than another. . . There is no such thing as moral truth. And many people have drawn this lesson somehow from twentieth century science and twentieth century philosophy. And now in the twenty first century, again, even very smart people, even, you know, physicist whose names will be well known to you, with whom I’ve collided around this point, that there is no place to stand to say that slavery is wrong. To say that slavery is wrong is a deeply unscientific statment on this view.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sam Harris goes on to point out that, according to the moral relativists, to say something critical about the Taliban is controversial. He also proposes an argument against this view: we should acknowledge that there is a link between morality and human well-being, and we do know something about human well-being, which gives us a place to stand to make decisions about how we all should live. David Deutsch, however, has a different response, which I find extremely insightful: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea that there can’t be such a thing as morality because we can’t do an experiment to test it, your answer to that seems to be ‘but we can if we adopt a simple assumption of human. . . well-being’. Now, I think that actually that’s true, but I don’t think you have to rest on that. I think the criterion of human well-being can be a conclusion, not an axiom.</p>

  <p>Because this idea that there can’t be any moral knowledge because it can’t be derived from the senses, is exactly the same argument that people made when they say there can’t be any scientific knowledge because it can’t be derived from the senses. In the twentieth century, empiricism was found to be nonsense, and some people therefore concluded that scientific knowledge is nonsense. But the real truth is that science is not based on empiricism, is based on reason, and so is morality. </p>

  <p>So, if you adopt a rational attitude to morality, and therefore say that morality consists of moral knowledge, which consists always of conjectures, doesn’t have any basis, doesn’t need a basis, only needs modes of criticism, and those modes of criticism operate by criteria, which are themselves subject to modes of criticism. Then, you come to a sort of transcendent moral truth from which your one emerges as an approximation, which is that institutions which suppress the growth of moral knowledge are immoral. Because they can only be right if the final truth is already known, but if all knowledge is conjectural and subject to improvement, then protecting the means of improving knowledge is more important than any particular piece of knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I must acknowledge that I have not yet read David Deutsch’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451744028&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=David+Deutsch">The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World</a></em>, as this podcast was my introduction to him. So I may not fully appreciate the meaning he packs behind words such as ‘knowledge’ or ‘criticism’. However, his words really resonated with me and clarified my own thinking. </p>

<p>For a long time, I have accepted that all knowledge is scientific, in the sense that all the views that we accept as truths are, whether we know it or not, nothing but hypotheses. In the best case scenario, we are aware of this and consider them susceptible of being replaced at any time by more accurate explanations. In the worst case scenario, we take them as absolute truths. I had however failed to make a connection between this point of view and morality.   </p>

<p>When it comes to morality, I have traditionally been a reluctant relativist. Maybe there is no such thing as absolute moral values, I thought, but the question is what do I stand for? What do I think is the best way to live, and am I willing to defend this opinion? I sensed a big disconnect between what my reason, my education and my culture were willing to say about morality, and what I felt in my bones to be right.</p>

<p>David Deutsch argument, briefly stated in this podcast and perhaps (hopefully) more elaborately explained in his book, gives me a framework about morality that already agrees with my way of thinking about knowledge and, to a certain extent, with my own moral values. In a way, Deutsch’s description of morality as consisting of moral knowledge subject to modes of criticism, describes an abstraction which encapsulates me and my views. I am an instrument (even if a tiny one) that moral knowledge uses to improve itself. I apply the modes of criticism. My life is, as is yours, a moral experiment.</p>

	<h2 class="visually-hidden"><a href="/pablo/2015/11/29/kahneman-on-risk.html">Kahneman on risk</a></h2>
<p class="drop-cap">As time goes by since I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555"><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></a>, there is a chapter that sticks in my head as one I particularly don&rsquo;t want to forget about. It is called &ldquo;Risk Policies&rdquo;, and I find it relevant for my current professional activity as an estimator, as well as my behavior as an investor:</p>
<blockquote><p>The great Paul Samuelson &mdash; a giant among the economists of the twentieth century&mdash;famously asked a friend (call him Sam) whether he would accept a gamble on the toss of a coin in which he could lose $100 or win $200. His friend responded, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t bet because I would feel the $100 loss more than the $200 gain. But I&rsquo;ll take you on if you promise to let me make 100 such bets.&rsquo;</p> 
	<p>. . . .</p> 
	<p>Now I have a sermon ready for Sam if he rejects the offer of a single highly favorable gamble played once, and for you if you share his unreasonable aversion to losses:</p>
	<div class="subquote">
		<p>I sympathize with your aversion to losing any gamble, but it is costing you a lot of money. Please consider this question: Are you on your deathbed? Is this the last offer of a small favorable gamble that you will ever consider? Of course, you are unlikely to be offered exactly this gamble again, but you will have many opportunities to consider attractive gambles with stakes that are very small relative to your wealth. You will do yourself a large financial favor if you are able to see each of these gambles as part of a bundle of small gambles and rehearse the mantra that will get you significantly closer to economic rationality: you win a few, you lose a few. . . . Remember these qualifications when using the mantra:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It works when the gambles are genuinely independent of each other; it does not apply to multiple investments in the same industry, which would all go bad together.</li>
			<li>It works only when the possible loss does not cause you to worry about your total wealth. If you would take the loss as significant bad news about your economic future, watch it!</li>
			<li>It should not be applied to long shots, where the probability of winning is very small for each bet.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you have the emotional discipline that this rule requires, you will never consider a small gamble in isolation or be loss averse for a small gamble until you are actually on your deathbed&mdash;and not even then.</p>
	</div>
	<p>This advice is not impossible to follow. Experienced traders in financial markets live it every day, shielding themselves from the pain of losses by <em>broad framing</em>.</p>
	<p>. . . .</p>
	<p>The combination of loss aversion and narrow framing is a costly curse.</p>
	<p>. . . .</p>
	<p>Decision makers who are prone to narrow framing construct a preference every time they face a risky choice. They would do better by having a <em>risk policy</em> that they routinely apply whenever a relevant problem arises. . . . A risk policy is a broad frame. . . . The relevant issue is your ability to reduce or eliminate the pain of the occasional loss by the thought that the policy that left you exposed to it will almost certainly be financially advantageous over the long run.</p>
	<p>A risk policy that aggregates decisions is analogous to the outside view of planning problems that I discussed earlier. The outside view shifts the focus from the specifics of the current situation to the statistics of the outcomes in similar situations. The outside view is a broad frame for thinking about plans. A risk policy is a broad frame that embeds a particular risky choice in a set of similar choices.</p>
	<p>The outside view and the risk policy are remedies against two distinct biases that affect many decisions: the exaggerated optimism of the planning fallacy and the exaggerated caution induced by loss aversion. The two biases oppose each other. Exaggerated optimism protects individuals and organizations from the paralyzing effects of loss aversion; loss aversion protects them from the follies of overconfident optimism. The upshot is rather comfortable for the decision maker. Optimists believe that the decisions they make are more prudent than they really are, and loss-averse decision makers correctly reject marginal propositions that they might otherwise accept. There is no guarantee, of course, that the biases cancel out in every situation. An organization that could eliminate both excessive optimism and excessive loss aversion should do so. The combination of the outside view with a risk policy should be the goal.</p>
	<p>Richar Thaler tells of a discussion about decision making he had with the top managers of the 25 divisions of a large company. He asked them to consider a risky option in which, with equal probabilities, they could lose a large amount of the capital they controlled or earn double that amount. None of the executives was willing to take such a dangerous gamble. Thaler then turned to the CEO of the company, who was also present, and asked for his opinion. Without hesitation, the CEO answered, &lsquo;I would like all of them to accept their risks.&rsquo; In the context of that conversation, it was natural for the CEO to adopt a broad frame that encompassed all 25 bets. Like Sam facing 100 coin tosses, he could count on statistical aggregation to mitigate the overall risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both as an estimator and as an investor, I should have a risk policy and be aware of the outside view. But, do I? I think so. They may not be perfect, but I do believe I have set up mechanisms that follow these general principles.</p>
<p>As an estimator, I keep track of actual historical costs from the field. I maintain an Excel database (in the process of being converted to MySQL) which reflects the actual costs charged to each of our activities. I also try to identify for each activity the factors that make it statistically significant, with columns, notes, drawings and pictures that reflect the actual conditions of the installation. This is the outside view: the detail and metadata provided by the database for each activity allow me to navigate the fine line between optimism and loss aversion by helping me choose production rates that are consistent with our history. But it is also the risk policy: my database allows me to aggregate our actual costs and the comparison with our estimated budgets for all our jobs. This aggregation provides the broad framing required to see individual bets as part of a larger set of bets.</p>
<p>As an investor, I have created an investment strategy that prevents me from making really dumb mistakes, and, hopefully, encourages me to make long-term bets with favorable odds and limited downside. Briefly explained, I only allow myself to trade once at the beginning of every quarter. I have set up reminders to check and rebalance my portfolio on January 1<sup>st</sup>, April 1<sup>st</sup>, July 1<sup>st</sup> and October 1<sup>st</sup>. If I don&rsquo;t adjust it on those dates (or up to a couple of days later if I don&rsquo;t get to it), then I have to leave my accounts alone for the rest of the quarter.</p>
<p>When I do rebalance my portfolio, I can only change the totals between my accounts by a very small percentage, currently not more than 2.5%. At any given point I can&rsquo;t transfer more than 2.5% of stocks to bonds or vice-versa. And I can&rsquo;t increase or decrease the allocation of any subcategory (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, international, etc) by more than 2.5%. This greatly limits the potential for mistakes caused by sudden decisions based on news, market information or emotions.</p>
<p>Any adjustments not-to-exceed 2.5% are made with a contrarian view in mind. By looking at several key indicators, among them the CAPE ratio, I try to slowly decrease my stock allocation when stocks are priced higher and increase it when they are cheaper. Finally, my overall stock allocation cannot be adjusted below a certain percentage based on my age, currently 70%. At any given point, even when I am at my most conservative, I am limited to a 30% fixed income percentage based on the fact that I am young worker with a really long time horizon.</p> 
<p>This discussion doesn&rsquo;t touch on dollar-cost-averaging, which is one of my favorite investment strategies, but also a default option and a no-brainer for retirement accounts.</p>
<p>I recognize that certain aspects of my investment approach are not standard practice recommended by experts for individual investors. I believe my approach is better. I could be wrong. I am incurring some risk of underperfomance, but I have implemented safeguards to limit that risk.</p>

	<h2 class="visually-hidden"><a href="/pablo/2015/10/24/bias-to-forget.html">Bias to forget</a></h2>
<p class="drop-cap">Now, that I have three boys to raise, a house to attend to, a full-time job and a side career as a developer, I no longer have the spare time I used to be able to enjoy. Naturally, some of the leisure activities that filled my time and seemed so indispensable back then, have disappeared from my life, mainly movies and reading books (at least books unrelated to programming). Before kids, I was an avid reader, and walked into the theater almost every weekend. Then there was Netflix in bed, and I started to leave books unfinished. And suddenly, my two main hobbies were gone.</p>
<p>While I still don&rsquo;t have a clear path back to watching full length movies, I have found a solution for my book problem: audiobooks. It is not the same experience, and I still miss being able to lay in bed for two hours with a paperback in my hand, but it is a last resort solution that works. Because, among other things, it has allowed me to &ldquo;read&rdquo;  a book that has been on my list for ages: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555"><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></a>, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman">Daniel Kahneman.</a></p>
<p><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> is every bit as good as I expected, and I think (I hope) I will be a better, more self-aware human for having read it. Or, I will be better if I can remember anything it says: I am afraid that a downside of audiobooks may be that it will be harder for me to remember what I read (listen to). Because, a very useful tool for remembrance, visual memory, the ability to remember an idea because you can visualize where on the page it was written, is not engaged when listening to an audiobook. So, now that I have almost finished the book, I am left wondering if I will remember anything at all. Will I be able to identify in me the biases that Kahneman lists in his book, or will I simply forget about them and move on with my life? There is one more bias that Kahneman doesn&rsquo;t talk about, which enables all the others: the bias to forget.</p>
<p>How to fight the bias to forget? One way could be to quote passages of the book right here. To type every word, every sentence that expresses an idea worth remembering and publish it on this site. This may make the idea stick around longer. So I am going to try. Here is Kahneman in the chapter <em>Expert Intuition: When Can We Trust It?</em></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Earlier I traced people&rsquo;s confidence in a belief to two related impressions: cognitive ease and coherence. We are confident when the story we tell ourselves comes easily to mind, with no contradiction and no competing scenario. But ease and coherence do not guarantee that a belief held with confidence is true. The associative machine is set to suppress doubt and to evoke ideas and information that are compatible with the currently dominant story. A mind that follows WYSIATI [What You See Is All There Is] will achieve high confidence much too easily by ignoring what it does not know. It is therefore not surprising that many of us are prone to have high confidence in unfounded intuitions. Klein and I eventually agreed on an important principle: the confidence that people have in their intuitions is not a reliable guide to their validity. In other words, do not trust anyone— including yourself— to tell you how much you should trust their judgement.</p>
	<p>If subjective confidence is not to be trusted, how can we evaluate the probable validity of an intuitive judgement? When do judgments reflect true expertise? When do they display an illusion of validity? The answer comes from the two basic conditions for acquiring a skill:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>an environment that is sufficiently regular to be predictable</li>
		<li>an opportunity to learn these regularities through prolonged practice</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When both these conditions are satisfied, intuitions are likely to be skilled. Chess is an extreme example of a regular environment, but bridge and poker also provide robust statistical regularities that can support skill. Physicians, nurses, athletes, and firefighters also face complex but fundamentally orderly situations. The accurate intuitions that Gary Klein has described are due to highly valid cues that expert&rsquo;s System 1 has learned to use, even if System 2 has not learned to name them. In contrast, stock pickers and political scientists who make long-term forecasts operate in a zero-validity environment. Their failures reflect the basic unpredictability of the events they try to forecast.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I just changed the entire navigation system of this site. This change consisted of deleting my single most polished feature, the one I have worked on for longest, which I was by far proudest of. A right-side, responsive, sliding menu with hamburger button. One that actually worked. It slid smoothly. It opened and closed at the right times, responding to the right events. It seemed elegant (except for a few extra divs, which always made me feel a little uncomfortable). It was progressively enhanced, so it failed gracefully.</p>
	<p>Among other things, this feature contained my longest self-written JavaScript file. It is possible that this file was not a universal example of the purest functional programming. But it was my file. I wrote it. It contained an IIFE, its variables declared at the top, its function declarations following right after. OK, I used jQuery, maybe I am not a vanilla JavaScript ninja quite yet. So perhaps you wouldn't be impressed, but I was, because it was mine.</p>
	<p>I really hope that the simplified navigation system really does make my site simpler, more coherent, better-looking. Because if it doesn't, if after sacrificing my most beloved code my site gets worse, I am going to be pissed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Today, Alexander tried out for the baseball all-star team. His season so far has been somewhat inconsistent. He started hitting the ball off the machine regularly, and then suffered through a period of three or four games of missing the ball every time. His throwing has improved a lot. His catching ability is still developing. He is fairly good with ground balls, but has a harder time catching pop flies or line drives.</p>
<p>The odds were against him, but he wanted to try anyway, because he still thought he could make it. He has such great attitude and is so optimistic. I think I was more nervous for him than he was. He seemed to be unfazed by the possibility of failure, had no hesitation to try out and really hoped for the best. I am not sure where this drive comes from, not from me or Jessica, but I deeply admire it and feel that it is going to take him far.</p>
<p>It turns out that he completed a great performance today. The first ball he hit went straight to the outfield, the next two came out bouncing, would probably have allowed him a double or a triple, depending on the quality of the field players. The fourth was a foul ball and the fifth one he missed. That's a lot better than some of the other kids did, even some that have had a better batting average during the season.</p>
<p>I was so incredibly proud of him. After batting, I went to help him get ready for the next drill, and he was so happy. I said "¡Good job Alexander!", and he replied with a smile: "¡A lo mejor me van a pick!". He has worked hard all year to get better, and it really showed today. I get emotional thinking about it.</p>
<p>Coach Damon just texted me to say that Alexander didn't get picked, and this kind of broke my heart. But the good news is that they may put a B team together, and he is fairly sure that Alexander would make that team. I bet Alexander will look at the bright side, and be excited about that.</p>

<p>What I don't like about literary fiction:</p>
<p>I find that most writers' imagination is not as complex and nuanced as reality itself, so why read the inferior creation of somebody's mind when you can delight in the intricacies of the real world.</p> 
<p>Often enough, writers like to appear brilliant by showing off their mastery of the language. But to me, their heavy choice of words doesn't let the story shine through. It's as though the writer were an obstacle standing between the story and the reader. I feel that a writer is at his best when he removes himself from the act of writing, and becomes purely an instrument that powerful stories and ideas use to spread themselves through history.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">If we had to pick an animal to describe our two older kids, Alexander would be a dog (loyal, dependable, resilient) and Max would be a cat (charming and loving, yet mercurial). Jessica and I discovered this last night, and couldn't help but laugh at the accuracy of the comparison.</p>
